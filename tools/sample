Bob_calm: Oh, really?...

Alice_sulk: C'mon, I'm like, qualifying for competitions and stuff, I have to practice.

Coach said at this rate I'll get through to the next round at regionals.

Bob_calm: Sigh... I guess I have nothing better to do.

Alice_grin: In fact, you can come swimming with me.

Bob_calm: So, not practicing for competitions after all.
