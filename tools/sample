Rosie_calm: Oh, really?...

Poppy_sulk: C'mon, I'm like, qualifying for competitions and stuff, I have to practice.

Rosie_calm: Sigh... I guess I have nothing better to do.

Poppy_shock: It wasn't me!

Rosie_super_peaceful: Of course not.

Poppy_grin: But it does mean you can drive me. In fact, you can come swimming with me.

Rosie_calm: So, not practicing for competitions after all.
