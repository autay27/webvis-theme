Rosie_calm: I swear they grew again... Am I imagining it...?

Rosie_peaceful: No, my hands can definitely cover less now. Nice.

Rosie_annoyed: But it might mean I have to buy new ones. Can I still use this one? Ugh, the hooks keep slipping -

Poppy_calm: Rosie, can you drive me to the pool today?

@rosie_poppylooking

Rosie_calm: Oh, really?...

Poppy_sulk: C'mon, I'm like, qualifying for competitions and stuff, I have to practice.

Rosie_calm: Sigh... I guess I have nothing better to do. After my friend cancelled on me and all.

Poppy_shock: It wasn't my fault!

Rosie_peaceful: Of course not.

Poppy_grin: But it does mean you can drive me. In fact, you can come swimming with me.

Rosie_calm: So, not practicing for competitions after all.

@poppy_bra_fix

Poppy_sulk: It's been ages since we played in the pool. It used to be so fun! Help me relive my happy memories.

Rosie_peaceful: When you put it like that how can I say no...

Poppy_smile: Great!

@poppy_bra_grope

Poppy_grin: Hehe, it's definitely too small. I can feel e-ve-ry-thing.

Rosie_annoyed: Ah! No pinching them! No teasing me! You little pervert...!

Rosie_blush: (She shouldn't really be touching me like that... But I know she doesn't mean it badly.

And I don't mind either.

I can't bear to tell Poppy off recently. She's been so clingy and moody after what happened...)

Rosie_calm: Knock knock.

Poppy_tears: What?

Rosie_calm: You've been shut in there all day. What's up?

Poppy_tears_sulk: ...

Rosie_calm: Something at school? Friends? Olivia?

Poppy_tears_sulk: Nn. She broke up with me.

Rosie_peaceful: Ah, I see. That must be tough.

Poppy_tears: No... It's exactly what I wanted.

Rosie_calm: ...?
